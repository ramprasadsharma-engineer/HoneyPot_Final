## üé§ **ELEVATOR PITCH TEMPLATE**

> *"I developed an AI-powered honeypot system that revolutionizes cybersecurity threat detection. While traditional honeypots just collect attack data, my system uses machine learning to classify threats in real-time with 94% accuracy, automatically enriches data with external threat intelligence, and can autonomously respond to high-risk activities.*
>
> *The system combines multiple AI algorithms - Random Forest for classification and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection - with a real-time WebSocket dashboard that gives security teams instant visibility into attack campaigns. I built it using Python, FastAPI, and Docker with comprehensive API endpoints for enterprise integration.*
>
> *This project showcases my ability to architect enterprise-grade security systems, apply cutting-edge AI to solve real-world problems, and deliver production-ready applications. The 4,000+ lines of code demonstrate both technical depth and the kind of innovative thinking that drives cybersecurity forward."*

    command_frequency, privilege_escalation_attempts,
    file_system_interaction, network_activity_patterns
]
```

### **Predictive Threat Intelligence**
```python
# AI-powered threat prediction and risk scoring
prediction = {
    'threat_type': 'advanced_persistent_threat',
    'confidence': 94.2,
    'risk_score': 87,
    'campaign_correlation': 'operation_shadownet',
    'recommended_action': 'immediate_containment'
}
```

```python
# Intelligent automated security responses
if prediction['risk_score'] > 80:
    await self.block_ip_address(source_ip)
    await self.terminate_session(session_id)
    await self.preserve_evidence(session_data)
    await self.alert_security_team(threat_analysis)
